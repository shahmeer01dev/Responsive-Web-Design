        <h1>Introduction</h1>
      </header>
      <p id="p-1">JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
        language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
        its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
      <p id="p-2">JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
        language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
        variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
      <ul id="list">
        <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document
          Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form
          and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
        <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a
          server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide
          continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on
          a server.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
      </p>
      <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }<br>greetMe("World");</code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_Variables">
      <header id="section-head">
        <h1>Declaring Variables</h1>
      </header>
      <p id="p-1">You can declare a variable in three ways: With the keyword var. For example,</p>
      <code>var x = 42.</code>
      <p id="p-2">This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables. By simply assigning it a value.
        For example,</p>
      <code>x = 42.</code>
      <p id="p-3">This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use
        this variant. With the keyword let. For example,</p>
      <code>let y = 13.</code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Scope">
      <header id="section-head">
        <h1>Variable Scope</h1>
      </header>
      <p id="part-1">When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is
        available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called
        a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
      <p id="part-2">JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared
        within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the
        following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is
        declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
      <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
      <p id="p-3">This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
      <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is<br>not defined</code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
      <header id="section-head">
        <h1>Constants</h1>
      </header>
      <p id="p-1">You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier
        is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain
        alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
      <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
      <p id="p-2">A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It
        has to be initialized to a value. The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope
        variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable. You cannot
        declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:</p>
      <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS<br>WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;<br>//statements }</code>
      <p id="p-3">However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.
      </p>
      <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
"otherValue";</code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
      <header id="section-head">
        <h1>Data Types</h1>
      </header>
      <p id="p-1">The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
      <ul id="list">
        <li>Six data types that are primitives:</li>
        <ul id="list">
          <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
          <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same
            as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
          <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
          </li>
          <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
          <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
          <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>and Object</li>
      </ul>
      <p id="p-2">Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions
        with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think
        of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.</p>
